# 🧠 Day 01 — Credit Card Fraud Detection 

> 🎯 *Advanced Data Cleaning & Outlier Detection Pipeline using Isolation Forests and Robust Scaling*

---

## 📘 Overview  

This project aims to predict **house prices** based on various features such as area, number of rooms, and location.  
It explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression model building to estimate property prices effectively.

---

## 📊 Dataset  

- **Source:** [Kaggle - House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
- **Description:** Contains features like `LotArea`, `YearBuilt`, `SalePrice`, etc.  
- **Shape:** 1460 rows × 81 columns  

---

## ⚙️ Workflow  

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Correlation heatmaps, distribution plots, feature insights  
3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Encoding categorical variables, scaling, and feature selection  
4. **Model Training**  
   - Algorithms used: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R² Score
