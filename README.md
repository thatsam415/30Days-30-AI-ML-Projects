# 🚀 30 Days Of 30 AI & ML Projects  

> 🎯 *A 30-day hands-on journey to build, learn, and grow — one Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning project every day.*

---

## 🌟 Overview  

Welcome to my **30 Days of 30 AI & ML Projects** — a self-paced journey where I’ll build **one project per day** focused on **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI applications.**  

Each project is designed to:  
- Strengthen my ML & AI fundamentals  
- Explore new datasets, models, and frameworks  
- Improve end-to-end project implementation skills  
- Document daily learning and progress  

---

## 🗓️ Challenge Goals  

✅ **Consistency:** Build one meaningful project every day  
✅ **Learning:** Reinforce theoretical concepts through implementation  
✅ **Exploration:** Work across multiple ML/AI domains  
✅ **Portfolio:** Create 30 fully documented mini-projects
